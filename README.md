## Introduction

In this course, I am learning about the development of embedded software for different applications. The repository serves as a centralized location for all the projects, drivers, and libraries I create during the duration of the course.

## Folder Structure

The repository has the following folder structure:

APP (Application code and projects)

MCAL (Microcontroller Abstraction Layer drivers)

HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer drivers)

LIB (Reusable libraries)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JOe-O/NTI-Embedded.git
```
2. Navigate to the relevant folders ('APP', 'MCAL', 'HAL', or 'LIB') to access the corresponding code, drivers, and libraries  and run the applications on your chosen hardware board.
